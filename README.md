UCI compatible deep neural network chess engine.

Hydra contains two main components:

- NN position evaluator.

Hydra is built on:
- The open source [libchess](https://github.com/Mk-Chan/libchess) library for board representation and move generation.
- The AlphaZero paper; [Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01815)
